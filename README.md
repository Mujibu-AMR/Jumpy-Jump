# Simple Game with HTML CSS JS

This is a simple jumping game(not a game at all) developed on the process of learning CSS Keyframes and Javascript.

## For Beginners Like Me

To beginner's those who want to understand the concept.
I've used nested <div> tag. 
setInterval() is used for two things.    
 * for updateScore (updating score every 100 millisecond).
 * for checking isAlive (to check whether the character collide with object).
 
 setTimeout() is used for clearing animation. Since animation time is 500 millisecond, we set 500 millisecond in the function. 

 ### Ideas

 I know my code may look ugly. So ideas and suggestions are welcomed.
